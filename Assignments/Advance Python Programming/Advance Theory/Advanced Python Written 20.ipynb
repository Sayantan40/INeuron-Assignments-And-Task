    "###  Both the `float` and `decimal` types store numerical values in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use `floats` when convenience and speed matter. A float gives you an approximation of the number you declare.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use `decimals` when precision matters. `Decimals` can suffer from their own precision issues, but generally, `decimals` are more precise than `floats`. The performance difference between `float` and `decimal`, with Python 3, is not outlandish, and in my experience, the precision benefits of a `decimal` outweigh the performance benefits of a `float`."
