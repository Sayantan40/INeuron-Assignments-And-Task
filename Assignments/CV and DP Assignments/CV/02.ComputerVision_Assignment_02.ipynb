    "**Ans:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data. CNNs use a combination of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to identify patterns in the data. Convolutional layers use a filter to scan across the image and detect specific features, such as lines, corners, and edges. Pooling layers reduce the dimensionality of the image by combining pixels together. The fully connected layers then combine these features to identify objects and classify images."

    "**Ans:** Refactoring parts of your neural network definition can make the code easier to understand, debug, and maintain. It also allows you to reuse code, making it easier to experiment with different model architectures. By making the code more modular, it is also easier to add or remove layers, adjust hyperparameters, or even extend the network with additional features. Refactoring can also help make your code more efficient, as it allows you to reuse code and optimize calculations."

    "**Ans:** To flatten is to transform a multi-dimensional array into a single dimensional array. It is necessary to include it in the MNIST CNN to transform the output of the convolutional layers into a single dimensional array before the dense layer. This is because the dense layer requires a one-dimensional array as input."

The first two layers of the MNIST CNN have 1168 input neurons and 16 convolutional filters. Each of these filters has a 7x7 parameter matrix, resulting in 1168 x 16 = 7 x 7 x (1168 - 16) multiplications."

    "**Ans:** A receptive field is a specific region in the visual field of an individual (or a neuron) that responds most strongly to a particular stimulus. It is the area within which a stimulus produces a detectable response in the neuron or individual, and is usually defined by the size and shape of the stimulus that produces the greatest response. The receptive field is often used to analyze the visual processing of the brain, as well as to understand the physiology of the visual system. Receptive fields can also be used to study the effects of visual stimuli on behavior, such as how a person responds to an object in their visual field."

    "**Ans:** The representation of an image can take many forms. Most of the time, it refers to the way that the conveyed information, such as color, is coded digitally and how the image is stored, i.e., how is structured an image file. Several open or patented standards were proposed to create, manipulate, store and exchange digital images. They describe the format of image files, the algorithms of image encoding such as compression as well as the format of additional information often called metadata.\n",

    "Tensors can be understood as nested lists of objects of the previous order all with the same size. For example, an order three tensor can be thought of as a list of matrices all of which have the same number of rows and columns. These matrices are tensors of order two and since they have all the same number of rows and columns, the tensor of order three is actually like a cuboid of numbers and we can find numbers by going along any of the three-axis. Each number is identified by the row, the column, and the depth at which itâ€™s stored. We can formalize this idea in the concept of shape."

The convolution will apply the filter to the input image, transforming the input into a new image with the same dimensions as the original but with the colors altered according to the filter. The convolution will essentially process the input image and create a new image with the desired color effects."
