    "**Ans:** Trainable parameters are parameters that are manipulated by the learning algorithm during the training process, such as weights and biases in a neural network. Non-trainable parameters are parameters that remain fixed during the training process, such as the number of layers or the activation function in a neural network."

    "**Ans:** The optimal number of hidden layers to stack depends on the complexity of the data and the type of neural network being used. Generally, more complex data requires more layers, whereas simpler data may require fewer layers. Generally, a range of 1 to 4 hidden layers is recommended, although in some cases more may be necessary."

It is used to determine the output of the neural network based on the input and the weights of the neurons. The activation function is usually applied after the weighted sum of the inputs is calculated to determine the output of a neuron."

    "**Ans:** Normalization of data is the process of organizing a database to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing a database into two or more tables and defining relationships between the tables. Normalization usually involves dividing a database table into smaller tables and defining relationships between them. The goal is to isolate data so that additions, deletions, and modifications of a field can be made in just one table and then propagated through the rest of the database using the defined relationships."

    "**Ans:** Image augmentation is a technique used to increase the size and diversity of a dataset of images by applying various transformations to each image in the dataset. These transformations can include rotation, scaling, flips, noise, and a variety of other effects. By applying these transformations to each image, it results in a larger dataset of images with different characteristics, which can be used to improve the performance of machine learning models."

It can be caused by a number of factors, including fatigue, lack of motivation, boredom, and poor teaching methods. It is important for educators to recognize the signs of a decline in learning rate and provide students with the necessary tools and resources to help them improve their learning."

    "**Ans:** Early stopping criteria is a method used in machine learning to determine when to stop training a model. It monitors the performance of the model, such as accuracy and loss, and stops training when the performance has reached a certain threshold or plateau. This prevents the model from overfitting and ensures that the model is as accurate and efficient as possible."
