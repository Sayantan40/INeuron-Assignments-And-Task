For example, in the mortgage case, `P(Y)` is the default rate on a home mortgage, which is `2%`. `P(Y|X)` is called the conditional probability, which provides the probability of an outcome given the evidence, that is, when the value of X is known."

    "The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple classifier that classifies based on probabilities of events. It is the applied  commonly to text classification. With the training set, we can train a Naive Bayes classifier which we can use to automaticall categorize a new sentence.\n",
    "- **Spam filtering:**        \n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers work by correlating the use of tokens (typically words, or sometimes other things), with spam and non-spam e-mails and then using Bayes' theorem to calculate a probability that an email is or is not spam.  It is one of the oldest ways of doing spam filtering, with roots in the 1990s.\n",
    "- **Market sentiment analysis:**    \n",
    "Market Sentiment analysis is a field dedicated to extracting subjective emotions and feelings from text. One common use of sentiment analysis is to figure out if a text expresses negative or positive feelings. Naive Bayes is a popular algorithm for classifying text."
